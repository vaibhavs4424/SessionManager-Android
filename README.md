# SessionManager-Android
Session Manager: This is a simple library project which you can use in your project to handle session in your android applications. This project will handle the session functionality and display a graphical timer at the end so that the user can extend the session as per his/her need or the default action will occur[logout]. The timer displayed in this library is designed in such a way that it will be displayed appropriately according to the device screen [phone/tablet].

Usage
-----

Include the library and add it as a dependency in the main project

Step1: 	Add the following line in your base activity.

		//Variable to hold the instance of session manager class
		protected static SessionManager mSession;
	
		//Default values of the total timer, i.e session time
		Long sessionTimeOut = 10000l;

		//Default value of the time for which timer is displayed
		Long sessionTimeOutCountDown = 5000l;
	
		//Creates the session for your project 
		mSession = new SessionManager(BaseActivity.this, sessionTimeOut, sessionTimeOutCountDown);

Step 2: Add the following lines in base activity's over-ridden method  

		@Override
		public void onUserInteraction() {
			super.onUserInteraction();
			mSession.resetSessionTimer();
		}

Step 3: Your base activity should listen to CountDownFinish	by implementing SessionManager.CountDownFinish	

		This adds overridden method 

		@Override
		public void onCountDownFinish() {
			//Perform what you want to countdown finish here
		}

Step 4: Finally add this to your manifest file 

		<activity
            android:name="com.example.sessionmanager.SessionActivity"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.Transparent"
            tools:replace="android:theme" />
